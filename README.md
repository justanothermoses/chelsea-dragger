## Install

Install package via npm

```sh
npm install chelsea-dragger
```

Import it to your script with `import` or `require` and add it to your vue app via `use()` method of your app instance:

```js
import ChelseaDragger from 'chelsea-dragger'
createApp(App).use(ChelseaDragger).mount('#app')
```

## General Usage

The following example uses the array of items shown below.

All items in this array are assigned to one of two lists by property `listId`.
The examples will implement draga and drop to update the an items `listId` by dragging the item and dropping it in the new list.

**Important**:
Keep in mind that [vue needs a unique key in a loop, if the items may change](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/list.html#maintaining-state-with-key).
For this reason all items have a unique `id`.

```js
const items = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: 'Some Item',
    listId: 1,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: 'Another Item',
    listId: 2,
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    title: 'Also an Item',
    listId: 2,
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    title: 'One more Item',
    listId: 1,
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    title: 'Okay still one more...',
    listId: 1,
  },
]
```

### Drag

To register an element as draggable, use the directive `v-draggable`.
This directive requires a value, that is passed as a reference to your [callback function and drop event](#drop), when dropped in a drop zone.

```js
      <div
         v-for="item in items.filter(item => item.listId === 1)"
         :key="item.id"
         v-draggable="item"
      >
        {{ item.title }}
      </div>
```

### Drop

To define an area, where items can be dropped, use The `DropZone` component.
You can just wrap it around any other elements, to mark this area as drop zone.

When an item is dropped, the drop zone will emit a `drop` event and invoke an optional `callback` property. In both cases one argument is passed, which is a **reference** to [the value that was passed when registering a draggable element via `v-directive`](#drag).

The example below shows two lists that update the items `listId`. The first list uses the `callback` property, the second one the `drop`-event.

```js
    <DropZone :callback="(item) => (item.listId = 1)">
      <div
        v-draggable="item"
        v-for="item in items.filter(item => item.listId === 1)"
        :key="item.id"
      >
        {{ item.title }}
      </div>
    </DropZone>

    <DropZone @drop="(item) => (item.listId = 2)">
      <div
        v-draggable="item"
        v-for="item in items.filter(item => item.listId === 2)"
        :key="item.id"
      >
        {{ item.title }}
      </div>
    </DropZone>
```
